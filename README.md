## What's Inside

### 118 ISO 27001:2022 Controls
- **93 Annex A controls** across Organizational, People, Physical, and Technological categories — each with its full **ISO 27002:2022 control statement**, **ISO 27002 Control Type** (Preventive / Detective / Corrective), and **Security Domain** (Governance and Ecosystem / Protection / Defence / Resilience)
- **25 Management System clauses** (Clauses 4–10) covering context, leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, and improvement

### 10 Mapped Frameworks

| Framework | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **NIST CSF 2.0** | 106 subcategories across 6 Functions and 22 Categories |
| **SOC 2 TSC** | 61 Trust Services Criteria (CC1–CC9, A1, PI1) |
| **CIS Controls v8** | 18 Controls and 153 Safeguards with IG1/IG2/IG3 tiers |
| **PCI DSS 4.0.1** | 12 Requirements with sub-requirement detail |
| **Cyber Essentials v3.1** | 5 technical control themes |
| **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** | 20 control families |
| **NIS 2 Directive** | 10 Article 21 security measures |
| **ISO 22301:2019** | 12 business continuity clause sections |
| **ISO 27017:2015** | 21 cloud security control sections |
| **NCSC CAF** | 4 Objectives / 14 Principles / 41 Contributing Outcomes with official IGP criteria |

Every framework reference shows the **full control statement** — not just an ID.

## Features

### Home Page — Readiness at a Glance
An overview page shows all 11 frameworks as donut charts, each reflecting your current audit readiness in real time (green = Implemented, amber = In Progress). Click any framework card to dive straight into its control list.

### Transitive Reverse Mapping
Switch the primary lens to **any** framework using the navigation tabs at the top. Select NIST CSF 2.0 as your primary view, and the tool automatically calculates transitive cross-mappings to SOC 2, CIS v8, PCI DSS, NIS 2, NCSC CAF, and every other framework — through the shared ISO 27001 controls underneath. No separate lookup table required; the mappings are computed on the fly.

### Full Hierarchy Views
Every framework is rendered in its native hierarchy structure:
- **NCSC CAF** — Objective → Principle → Contributing Outcome, with official Indicators of Good Practice (IGP) criteria per outcome
- **NIST CSF 2.0** — Function → Category → Subcategory
- **SOC 2** — Trust Services Category → Criteria Group → Criterion
- **CIS v8** — Control Group → Safeguard (with IG1/2/3 breakdown)
- **PCI DSS** — Goal → Requirement → Sub-requirement
- **Cyber Essentials** — Theme → Requirement

Framework items with no current ISO mapping are still shown so you can score and track them.

### Compliance Scoring
Track implementation status for each control with a four-state selector:
- **Not started** (red) — work has not begun
- **In progress** (amber) — partially implemented
- **Implemented** (green) — fully in place
- **Not Applicable** (grey) — excluded from your ISMS scope (Annex A only)

Scores persist in your browser between sessions. Each framework tracks its own scores independently.

### Statement of Applicability (SoA)
For ISO 27001 Annex A controls, selecting **Not Applicable** reveals a justification text field to record the exclusion reason. The **SoA export button** in the toolbar generates a formal Statement of Applicability CSV covering all 93 Annex A controls — regardless of any active filters — including:
- Applicable (Yes / No)
- Justification text
- ISO 27002:2022 control statement
- Control Type and Security Domain
- Implementation status

### Evidence Tracking
Each expanded control includes a pre-populated **Typical Evidence to Collect** checklist. For every evidence type:
- Tick items as you gather them
- Add a document reference (name, SharePoint link, Jira ticket, etc.)
- Leave free-text notes in an Additional Notes field

All evidence data is saved locally and included in Excel exports.

### Sidebar Filters
Stackable filter pills across all frameworks. ISO 27001–specific filters include:
- **ISO Category** — Management System, Organizational, People, Physical, Technological
- **NIST CSF Function** — Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **SOC 2** — CC1–CC9, A1, P1
- **CIS Controls v8** — Controls 1–18
- **PCI DSS** — Requirements 1–12
- **Cyber Essentials** — Access Control, Secure Config, Firewalls, Malware Protection, Security Updates
- **NIST 800-53** — All 20 families
- **NIS 2** — Article 21 measures (a)–(j)
- **ISO 22301** — Clause sections
- **ISO 27017** — Section references
- **NCSC CAF** — Objectives A–D
- **Status** — Not started / In progress / Implemented / Not Applicable
- **ISO 27002 Control Type** — Preventive / Detective / Corrective *(ISO 27001 view only)*
- **ISO 27002 Security Domain** — Governance and Ecosystem / Protection / Defence / Resilience *(ISO 27001 view only)*

All filters stack for precise cross-framework queries. One-click "Clear all" resets everything.

### Smart Search
- **In-framework search** — filters controls within the active framework view
- **Global search mode** — toggle the "All frameworks" button to search across every framework simultaneously; results show coloured framework badges; click any badge to jump to that framework view
- Autocomplete suggestions as you type
- Search by control ID (A.5.17), framework reference (CC6.1, CIS 5), or keyword (MFA, encryption, access control)

### Hierarchy-Aware Exports
**CSV export** and **Excel (XLSX) export** include hierarchical parent columns matched to each framework (Objective + Principle for NCSC CAF; Function + Category for NIST CSF 2.0; etc.). The export never includes a column mapping the framework back to itself.

Excel exports additionally include:
- Colour-coded rows by implementation status
- Control Type and Security Domain columns for ISO 27001
- SoA Justification column
- All evidence, assessor notes, and implementation guidance
- A **Charts Guide** sheet with ready-made COUNTIF formulas for readiness pie and bar charts

## Why This Tool?

**The Problem:** GRC professionals waste hours jumping between framework PDFs to find equivalent controls. Mapping across frameworks manually is tedious, error-prone, and has to be done differently depending on which framework you start from.

**The Solution:** 118 ISO 27001:2022 controls mapped to 10 frameworks in one searchable, filterable interface — with transitive reverse mapping from any framework's perspective, full control hierarchies, compliance tracking, evidence checklists, and a formal SoA export.

**The Impact:** What used to take hours now takes seconds. One tool for audit prep, gap assessments, implementation planning, Statement of Applicability generation, and multi-framework compliance.
